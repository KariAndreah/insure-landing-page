# Here is a landing page based on a challenge from frontend-mentor. [Here it is live!](https://kariandreah.github.io/insure-landing-page/)

# Production Journal
## Day 1: 
Styled whole page except topnav and the svg background elements.

## Day 2: 
Finished whole desktop design. 
**Tomorrow**
Need to style mobile design

## Day 3:
Was having issues with mobile nav. Realized you create the div and then toggle the display. My nav ran into issues with the positioning intro:after/ :before. But I realized that I just needed to change them from absolute.
